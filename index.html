  <!-- CODE REVIEW -->
  <section>
    <div class="category-label">Milestone One</div>
    <h2>Code Review</h2>
    <p>
      A code review involves systematically examining source code before enhancements begin. It is a critical step in professional software development, enabling developers to identify architectural weaknesses, security vulnerabilities, opportunities for improvement and to communicate those findings clearly to collaborators and stakeholders.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my code review, I walk through the original CS 360 Inventory Management application, analyzing its activity-based architecture, in-memory storage limitations, basic UI, and security gaps. I then outline the three planned enhancement categories: Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Databases.

  <section>
    <div class="category-label">Milestone Two &nbsp;·&nbsp; Enhancement One</div>
    <h2>Software Design &amp; Engineering</h2>
    <p>
      The original artifact was a CS 360 Android Inventory Management application built with a tightly coupled, activity-based architecture where UI classes directly manipulated data. It was design that made the application difficult to test, maintain, or scale.
    </p>
    <h3>What Was Enhanced</h3>
    <p>
      The application was fully restructured using the <strong>MVVM architectural pattern</strong>, introducing a dedicated ViewModel to manage UI-related data and a Repository layer to abstract all data access. LiveData was implemented throughout for reactive, lifecycle-aware UI updates; eliminating manual refresh logic and preventing memory leaks during configuration changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The user interface was rebuilt with Material Design components including MaterialCardView, MaterialButton, and TextInputLayout, replacing the basic grid with a RecyclerView using the ViewHolder pattern for efficient rendering. A low-stock visual indicator was added using color coding so users can immediately identify items needing attention. All input validation and error handling were centralized in the ViewModel, and hardcoded strings were moved to string resources for future localization.

  <!-- ENHANCEMENT 2 -->
  <section>
    <div class="category-label">Milestone Three &nbsp;·&nbsp; Enhancement Two</div>
    <h2>Algorithms &amp; Data Structures</h2>
    <p>
      Building on the MVVM foundation, this enhancement focused on implementing meaningful algorithmic logic and efficient data structures within the ViewModel and Repository layers.
    </p>
    <h3>What Was Enhanced</h3>
    <p>
      Five distinct sorting options were implemented using Kotlin's TimSort with composite comparators. Including a <strong>LOW_STOCK_PRIORITY</strong> mode that uses a multi-key comparator to surface urgent items first. A hand-implemented <strong>binary search</strong> (O(log n)) was added with full precondition documentation. Linear filtering algorithms (O(n)) were built for low-stock, in-stock, and category-based filtering. A <strong>HashMap-based groupByCategory</strong> function enables O(1) category lookup and powers expandable list views.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of these were wired reactively using <strong>MediatorLiveData</strong>, which observes the item list, sort option, filter option, and category filter simultaneously, automatically recomputing the displayed list whenever any source changes.

  <section>
    <div class="category-label">Milestone Four &nbsp;·&nbsp; Enhancement Three</div>
    <h2>Databases</h2>
    <p>
      Prior to this enhancement, the application stored all inventory data in a MutableLiveData list. Volatile memory that was lost every time the app was closed. This milestone replaced that placeholder with a production-level persistent database layer.
    </p>
    <h3>What Was Enhanced</h3>
    <p>
      The <strong>Room Persistence Library</strong> was integrated as the database layer, replacing in-memory storage with a SQLite-backed solution that persists data across app sessions. The DAO interface defines all database interactions using annotation-based queries, Room generates the full SQL implementation at compile time. All queries are parameterized by default, <strong>eliminating SQL injection as an attack surface</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Database operations (insert, update, delete) run on a background coroutine using Kotlin's IO dispatcher, keeping the main thread unblocked. The database class follows the Singleton pattern with double-checked locking and a <code>@Volatile</code> instance variable for thread safety. Because the Repository abstraction was already in place from Milestone Two, the transition required changes only to that layer. The ViewModel and UI were completely unaffected, validating the architectural decisions made earlier.

  <!-- PROFESSIONAL SELF-ASSESSMENT -->
  <section>
    <div class="category-label">Final Submission</div>
    <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>

    <div class="assessment-intro">
      <p>I began the Computer Science program in 2023 with a foundational understanding of programming and a goal of building a career in data analytics and data engineering. Completing this ePortfolio has been the most meaningful step in that journey, it forced me to look back at work I had already done, recognize its weaknesses honestly, and transform it into something I am genuinely proud to show an employer.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="topic-block">
      <h3>Collaborating in a Team Environment</h3>
      <p>Throughout the program, I developed an understanding of what it means to work within a collaborative software development context. In CS 250 (Software Development Lifecycle), I was introduced to Agile methodologies and the importance of iterative development, sprint planning, and peer review as mechanisms for producing better software than any one person could produce alone. I learned that collaborative environments depend not just on technical skill but on communication and being able to explain a design decision clearly, accept critical feedback without defensiveness, and document code in a way that other developers can read and build upon. The code review completed in this capstone was a direct application of that skill. My enhanced application reflects this through thorough inline documentation with every class and method including a comment explaining not just what the code does, but why it was designed that way, which is the standard expected in collaborative development environments.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="topic-block">
      <h3>Communicating with Stakeholders</h3>
      <p>One of the more transferable skills I developed across this program is the ability to adapt technical communication to different audiences. In CS 320 (Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance), I practiced writing test plans and defect reports that needed to be understood by both developers and non-technical project managers. That experience shaped how I approach documentation. I learned that the goal is never to impress with jargon but to communicate clearly enough that the right people can make informed decisions. In this capstone, my milestone narratives reflect that skill. Rather than simply listing what I changed, each narrative explains the reasoning behind each decision, like why MVVM is preferable to activity-based architecture, why Room's parameterized queries prevent SQL injection, and why MediatorLiveData was the right tool for reactive multi-source filtering.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="topic-block">
      <h3>Data Structures and Algorithms</h3>
      <p>My understanding of data structures and algorithms deepened significantly through CS 260 and was directly applied in this capstone. I learned how algorithm selection is not just an academic exercise but a practical decision with real performance consequences. For the capstone, I implemented multiple sorting algorithms using composite comparators, a hand-implemented binary search with O(log n) complexity and proper precondition documentation, linear filtering operations with O(n) complexity, and HashMap-based category grouping. Each came with explicit complexity analysis in the code comments; because thinking in terms of Big O notation is a habit that matters at production scale. I also implemented MediatorLiveData to reactively combine multiple data sources into a single computed output, which is itself an architectural expression of data transformation logic that scales cleanly as requirements grow.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="topic-block">
      <h3>Software Engineering and Databases</h3>
      <p>The most comprehensive growth I experienced was in software engineering discipline and database design. Courses like CS 360 introduced me to Android development, but it was the process of revisiting and transforming that original work in this capstone that taught me what professional software engineering actually requires. I migrated a tightly coupled application into a clean MVVM architecture with a Repository pattern, ViewBinding, LiveData, and a Room database backed by proper DAO interfaces and a thread-safe singleton pattern. I learned that architectural decisions made early in a project have a compounding effect on every future change. Because I had separated concerns properly in the earlier milestones, adding the Room database in Milestone Four required almost no changes to the ViewModel or UI layers. That experience made the value of separation of concerns tangible in a way that reading about it never could.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="topic-block">
      <h3>Security</h3>
      <p>Developing a security mindset has been one of the most important shifts in how I think about software. In CS 405 (Secure Coding), I was introduced to the principle that security is not a feature added at the end, it is a design constraint that shapes every decision from the beginning. That principle is visible throughout my capstone. Room's DAO interface uses parameterized queries by default; eliminating SQL injection as an attack surface and I documented this explicitly in the code. I built a dedicated <code>InputValidator</code> utility class that centralizes all input sanitization logic, ensuring no raw user input ever reaches the database layer without validation. I used <code>applicationContext</code> to prevent memory leaks, declared the database instance with <code>@Volatile</code> to guarantee thread-safe visibility, and used double-checked locking in the singleton pattern to prevent race conditions during initialization.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>How My Artifacts Fit Together</h3>
    <div class="artifacts-grid">
      <div class="artifact-card">
        <span class="num">Enhancement 01</span>
        <strong>Software Design &amp; Engineering</strong>
        <p style="color:#8a9ab5; font-size:0.85rem; margin-top:8px; margin-bottom:0;">Established the MVVM architectural foundation that made all future enhancements possible without restructuring.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="artifact-card">
        <span class="num">Enhancement 02</span>
        <strong>Algorithms &amp; Data Structures</strong>
        <p style="color:#8a9ab5; font-size:0.85rem; margin-top:8px; margin-bottom:0;">Populated the architecture with sorting, filtering, binary search, and reactive data transformation logic.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="artifact-card">
        <span class="num">Enhancement 03</span>
        <strong>Databases</strong>
        <p style="color:#8a9ab5; font-size:0.85rem; margin-top:8px; margin-bottom:0;">Completed the system with persistent Room storage, validating every prior architectural decision by requiring changes only to the Repository layer.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>Together, these three enhancements tell the story of a developer who can take existing code, evaluate it critically, plan meaningful improvements across multiple dimensions, and execute those improvements in a disciplined and professional way. That is the skill I am bringing to a career in data analytics and data engineering.</p>
